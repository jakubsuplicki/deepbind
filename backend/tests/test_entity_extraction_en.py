"""Comprehensive English language entity extraction tests.

Tests entity extraction quality for English text. While Jarvis is primarily
a Polish-language system, users may write mixed-language notes, read English
books, reference English-speaking colleagues, and use English in many contexts.

Tests cover:
1. Basic person name extraction
2. Multi-word and compound names
3. Known person matching and confidence boosting
4. Deduplication across models (PL + EN)
5. False positive resistance — tech terms, products, companies
6. False positive resistance — place names, day/month names
7. Task list and bullet-point context
8. Book and article references
9. Meeting notes context
10. Email / message context
11. Title prefixes (Dr., Prof., Mr., Mrs.)
12. Hyphenated and multi-part names
13. Organizations vs persons
14. Confidence scoring
15. Single-word names with existing_people
16. Mixed EN/PL text
17. Edge cases

Each test documents EXPECTED behavior for English NER in Jarvis.
